# Weather-forecast
A site where users could check the weather forecasts of global locations by providing their coordinates.

# IMPORTANT!
Since the Dark Sky API, which charges bills for every call made after 1000 calls every day, is used in this project, <br\>please go get your own API key in https://darksky.net/dev and replace {YOUR API KEY} in variable api in weather.js with your key. 

Similarly, replace {YOUR API KEY} in api2 with the api key you get from https://timezonedb.com/api.
